  <h1>About Tribal Goods Trail</h1>

  <p>Tribal Goods Trail was created to support and uplift Native-owned businesses, artisans, vendors, and community sellers across Oregon, the Pacific Northwest, and—eventually—the entire United States. Whether someone operates a licensed storefront or sells beadwork, foods, crafts, or cultural items independently, they deserve visibility and support.</p>

  <p>This app is inspired by my longtime connection to the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. My wife and children come from Warm Springs, and I spent 15 years living and working in the community. Tribal Goods Trail is one way I honor that connection while giving back in a meaningful way.</p>

  <p>My path hasn’t been perfect, but building this app is part of my commitment to growth, accountability, and supporting Native entrepreneurs with respect and accuracy.</p>

  <p>I do not claim Tribal affiliation. This platform simply highlights Native-owned sellers who choose to share their work, skills, and culture with others.</p>

  <p>Tribal Goods Trail listings are always free for Native-owned businesses and community sellers. No account is required to use the app, and the map updates live whenever a submission is approved.</p>
