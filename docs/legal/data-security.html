<h1>Data Security Practices</h1>

<p>We safeguard data used by Tribal Goods Trail through the following controls:</p>

<h2>Platform and Storage</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Data is stored in Firebase with encryption at rest and in transit (TLS).</li>
  <li>Back-end access is limited to the verified administrator via authenticated consoles.</li>
  <li>Access is logged through provider tooling where available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Minimization</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We collect only the submission details needed to list businesses and support verification.</li>
  <li>We do not store precise location history; proximity is calculated on the device when possible.</li>
  <li>We avoid collecting sensitive personal data that is not required for the service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No sale of personal data.</li>
  <li>Limited sharing with trusted service providers (e.g., Firebase) to operate the app.</li>
  <li>No third-party marketing trackers are provided with personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>If you suspect a security issue, please email <a href="mailto:a.gentry88@icloud.com" style="color:#79e8ff;">a.gentry88@icloud.com</a>.</p>
