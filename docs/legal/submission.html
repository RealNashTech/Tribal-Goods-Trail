  <h1>Submission Standards</h1>

  <h2>Business Definitions & Vendor Responsibility</h2>
  <p>Tribal Goods Trail allows submissions from Native-owned “businesses,” which may include individuals who sell goods, artwork, food items, crafts, or services with or without formal business registration. A seller is not required to operate an LLC, corporation, or registered business to be listed in the directory.</p>

  <p>Tribal Goods Trail does not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>verify business licensing, food-safety compliance, tax status, or regulatory adherence;</li>
    <li>certify the authenticity of cultural items under the Indian Arts & Crafts Act;</li>
    <li>verify Tribal enrollment or enrollment claims;</li>
    <li>guarantee product quality, safety, or legality.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All sellers are solely responsible for complying with applicable Tribal, State, and Federal laws governing their activities. Users who choose to purchase goods from listed vendors assume all associated risks.</p>

  <h2>Cultural Goods & Indian Arts & Crafts Act Notice</h2>
  <p>Vendors who sell artwork, beadwork, regalia-inspired items, or cultural goods are solely responsible for ensuring that their products comply with the Indian Arts & Crafts Act (IACA). Tribal Goods Trail does not determine or guarantee the authenticity, Tribal affiliation, or legal compliance of cultural items. By submitting a listing, vendors agree they are accurately representing themselves and their goods.</p>
