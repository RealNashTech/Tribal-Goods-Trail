  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <h2>Business Definitions & Vendor Responsibility</h2>
  <p>Tribal Goods Trail allows submissions from Native-owned “businesses,” which may include individuals who sell goods, artwork, food items, crafts, or services with or without formal business registration. A seller is not required to operate an LLC, corporation, or registered business to be listed in the directory.</p>

  <p>Tribal Goods Trail does not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>verify business licensing, food-safety compliance, tax status, or regulatory adherence;</li>
    <li>certify the authenticity of cultural items under the Indian Arts & Crafts Act;</li>
    <li>verify Tribal enrollment or enrollment claims;</li>
    <li>guarantee product quality, safety, or legality.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All sellers are solely responsible for complying with applicable Tribal, State, and Federal laws governing their activities. Users who choose to purchase goods from listed vendors assume all associated risks.</p>

  <h2>Independent Sellers</h2>
  <p>Vendors listed on Tribal Goods Trail are independent and are not employees, agents, contractors, or representatives of Tribal Goods Trail. We do not supervise, manage, endorse, or validate their business practices or legal compliance. Tribal Goods Trail is a directory-only platform and does not participate in or oversee transactions between users and vendors.</p>
