Tribal Goods Trail

Tribal Goods Trail is a free, map-based directory that helps people find Native-owned businesses, artists, creators, and community sellers across Oregon and the Pacific Northwest — with plans to expand nationwide.

The goal is simple: make it easier for people to discover Native-owned shops, food, art, cultural goods, services, and community-based sellers. No account is required. Listings appear on an interactive real-time map after a quick manual review to ensure clarity, cultural respect, and alignment with platform guidelines.

Purpose

Native-owned businesses and cultural sellers deserve visibility—whether they run a storefront, travel as vendors, or sell directly within their communities. Tribal Goods Trail supports:

officially registered businesses and LLCs

Tribal enterprises and Native-led nonprofits

community sellers such as salmon makers, beadworkers, jerky sellers, firewood sellers, and huckleberry gatherers

powwow vendors and seasonal sellers

independent Native artists and creators

Listings come from seller submissions and publicly available information, including Tribal enterprise websites, nonprofit registries, and other open business directories.

How Listings Work

Sellers self-identify as Native American, Alaska Native, or Indigenous and confirm the accuracy of their information. Tribal Goods Trail does not verify Tribal enrollment or citizenship.

During review, the platform checks for:

clarity of information

alignment with guidelines

cultural respect

truthful self-identification as stated by the seller

Tribal Goods Trail does not verify:

business licenses or registration

food safety or health permits

tax status or legal compliance

authenticity of cultural goods under the Indian Arts & Crafts Act (IACA)

Sellers are responsible for their legal compliance. Users are responsible for their interactions and transactions with listed businesses.

Key principles:

Listings are not endorsements

Tribal Goods Trail is not a marketplace and does not process transactions

Sellers self-identify as Native-owned; Tribal enrollment is not verified

Cultural goods fall under the seller’s responsibility and may be subject to IACA

Some listings originate from publicly accessible sources

This legal structure helps ensure safety, transparency, and respect for Native communities and users.
